    "# Metropolis-Hastings - I. Finding the time shift between two noisy time series\n",
    "\n",
    "A central theme in numerous applications is the estimation of time shifts between two noisy time series $s_1(t)$ and $s_2(t)$. This can be set as an inverse problem, where the model parameter $m$ is the time shift $\\delta$. The goal is to obtain a probability density that describes the likelihood of $d=s_2(t-\\delta)$ being equal to $s_1(t)$. $$ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As data prior, $p(d^\\text{obs}|m)=p(d^\\text{obs}|\\delta)$, we use a Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$ set equal to the noise level in the data, i.e., $$ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p(d^\\text{obs}|m) = const.\\,\\exp{\\left[-\\frac{1}{2N\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N [s_1(t_i)-s_2(t_i-\\delta)]^2\\right]}\\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of samples in the time series. For the prior in model space, $p(m)=p(\\delta)$, i.e., the prior information on $\\delta$, we choose a constant. This corresponds to the assumption that we know very little about the time shift before looking at the actual time series. $$ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to sample the posterior distribution of the time shift $\\delta$ with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and to determine the maximum-likelihood time shift using simulated annealing. We will use synthetically generated time series instead of real data, because this allows us to investigate the effect of the noise level on the quality of our inferences."
